her=Greetings, stranger. It is not often anybody visits our small town. Please make yourself at home.
you=Do you know how I can get into the Castle?
her=Yes, but first can I ask a favor of you?
you=What do you want?
her=Can you destroy all the Antilons in the Infested Caves to the west of the Grasslands? They are upsetting the mining...
you=Of course.

you=Yes.
her=Thank you - you can have this reward.
her=The castle cannot easily be entered - Nex only allows his close friends and his evil creatures to enter.
her=However, there is a secret entrance which can be opened with 9 artifacts that are guarded by several powerful undead warriors.
her=Rumor has it that one of them hides in the caves you were just in.
her=Be careful though, as he is dangerous.

her=I would not expect you to be able to do that, but seeing as you have the sword as proof, you should go show it to the magician.
