topic=Book of the Dead
requires_status=emp_main_init
requires_not_status=emp_main_underworld
you=What can you tell me about the Book of the Dead?
him=The Book of the Dead tells of redemption for those who sign their name in gravebloom ink. Your sins will be washed away, and you will be able to return to wherever you were banished from.
you=So, where can I find gravebloom ink?
him=Gravebloom ink is not something you find. You must make it yourself. Besides the Gravebloom flower, you will need to sacrifice your own blood with a special blade.
him=Even if you can create some gravebloom ink, you won't be able to write with just anything. The ink won't stick to a normal quill. You will need to find something capable of holding the gravebloom ink.
him=If you can perform the ritual to make gravebloom ink and find a suitable writing utensil, redemption may be yours.

him=Ah yes, that is most certainly a gravebloom flower. It is the primary component in the creation of gravebloom ink.

[dialog]
topic=Black Quill
requires_status=emp_main_quill
requires_not_status=emp_main_underworld
you=Do you think this quill is capable of holding gravebloom ink?
him=It's certainly no normal quill. I've never seen anything like it.
set_status=emp_main_info2
him=If anything is capable of writing with gravebloom ink, it is that quill.

requires_status=emp_main_knife
requires_not_status=emp_main_bloodvial
you=Do you know anything about this knife?
set_status=emp_main_info3
him=The Knife of Sacrifices. This must be the blade you will need to draw your blood for the gravebloom ink. From what I've read, this must be done at the "Red Altar".
you=I recall such an altar from the Temple of Mez.
him=I don't know why this blade in particular is required to make the ink. Once it pierces your skin, there is no telling what effect it will have on you. Please keep this in mind.

[dialog]
topic=Vial of Blood
requires_status=emp_main_bloodvial
requires_not_status=emp_main_bloodinkwell
you=I completed the ritual at the Red Altar. What now?
him=We are ready to create a small amount of gravebloom ink. Allow me to perform the mixing.
him=The correct ratio of Gravebloom to blood is important. Too much Gravebloom will cause the ink to eat through the paper. Too little Gravebloom and the ink won't adhere to the quill.
him=(Florin carefully mixes the two elements into a small inkwell, alternating the additions of Gravebloom and blood.)

him=The ritual is complete. The Underworld is open to you.
you=There was a portal to the Underworld in the Wizard's Tower. I shall return there.
