her=Greetings stranger. It's not often that we have people come here from the west.
her=I see that you're carrying a weapon. Would you be interested in helping us?
you=Go on.
her=One of our encampment's residents, Krolan, works in the nearby mines. He supplies me with various gems that I craft into jewelery.
her=Krolan has not returned in some time, and I am starting to think the worst.
her=Could you please travel to the mines and look for Krolan? I will find some way to reward you for your trouble.

you=I have found Krolan, but he was no longer of this world.
her=This is terrible news. Our camp is already small, so this is a devastating loss.
you=If it's any solace, I have his key and this emerald. Mementos to remember him by.
her=The key is enough of a memento. For your invaluable help, I can at least make you a ring with this emerald.
