# Flare Fallen Kingdom Mod
Current Version: V1.4.1

Requires the FLARE engine found here: https://github.com/flareteam/flare-engine
Default game found here: https://github.com/flareteam/flare-game

4 different classes: Mage (NEW V1.2), Asassin (NEW V1.1), Warrior (NEW V1.0) and Sniper (NEW V1.0) (And "Developer" for testing.)

Complete rework of the powers system, now powers cannot be upgraded, and bows and slingshots require ammo. Knives and axes can be thrown, and are found more commonly. All players start with a knife, but the Warrior starts with a shortsword.

V1.4.2:
Added an Intro cutscene

Removed useable boss weapons due to storyline rework

Added a wand of Corruption that does no damage and requires HP, but has a chance to convert an enemy when it hits them. This effect only lasts 10 seconds, but it can be used on any enemy, even bosses.

Added a new Desert map, more content will branch off from it in future.
