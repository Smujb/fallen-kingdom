# Flare Fallen Kingdom Mod
Current Version: V1.4.1

Requires the FLARE engine found here: https://github.com/flareteam/flare-engine
Default game found here: https://github.com/flareteam/flare-game

4 different classes: Mage (NEW V1.2), Asassin (NEW V1.1), Warrior (NEW V1.0) and Sniper (NEW V1.0) (And "Developer" for testing.)

Complete rework of the powers system, now powers cannot be upgraded, and bows and slingshots require ammo. Knives and axes can be thrown, and are found more commonly. All players start with a knife, but the Warrior starts with a shortsword.

V1.4.1:

Improved the Desert map and the second boss room

Fixed the Developer teleporting power

Buffed the Shortsword

Added Lorsion's Blade as a useable weapon. Consider using the boss weapons as a kind of "Easy mode". Balance changes may be made to it in future.

Made the Desert map availible to non-developer classes

Added Skeleton enemies who have high evasion but low HP for their level
