V1.4.1 (Latest):

Improved the Desert map and the second boss room

Fixed the Developer teleporting power

Buffed the Shortsword

Added Lorsion's Blade as a useable weapon. Consider using the boss weapons as a kind of "Easy mode". Balance changes may be made to it in future.

Made the Desert map availible to non-developer classes

Added Skeleton enemies who have high evasion but low HP for their level


V1.4.0:

Made armour a more common drop

Added a new boss fight

Added bonuses to the new armour

Nerfed the Lucky Pendant and Book of Sacrifice

Added a new boss fight in the forest area on the big map


V1.3.3:

Added the Desert and Snow tilesets and a Desert map for testing (Developer Only)

Added a Developer power to return to spawn if softlocked (Occasionally crashes the game although I beleive this is an issue with the engine, not my code)


V1.3.2:

Added the Book of Sacrifice and Lucky Pendant

Increased gold loot chance and amount


V1.3.1:

Reduced Lorsion's health to 1600, reduced his melee damage to 30-45

Slowed the spawn rate of Antilon Queen's minions

Added the "Developer" class for testing purposes

Removed the spawn that took you to Gormel's boss room unless you are a developer (he is far from finished and needs a rework)


V1.3:

Added armour

Added cursed Items - currently only a wand and armour. Cursed items are normally more powerful but have some trade-off.

Rebalanced the Lightning wand.

Made epic items more commonly sold by the Blacksmith again, however not quite at the same level as before.
